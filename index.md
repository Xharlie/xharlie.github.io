I am Qiangeng(Charlie) Xu, a Ph.D. candidate (starting 2018 Aug) at the <a href="https://sites.usc.edu/cgit/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">CGIT lab</font></a> in the <a href="https://www.cs.usc.edu/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Computer Science Department</font></a> of USC, supervised by Professor <a href="https://sites.usc.edu/cgit/contact/ulrich-neumann/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Ulrich Neumann</font></a>. 
<br />

I will be graduating by the end of 2022 and currently on the job market for full-time opportunities!
<br />

My research interests and experiences range from 3D scene understanding (segmentation, detection and representation learning of 3D Point Cloud); 3D geometry learning, reconstruction and neural rendering. I also like to explore meta-learning, constrastive learning, information bottle neck theory and novel learning schemes.  
<br />
Previously I got my B.E. in Aeronautics Engineering from Beihang University(BUAA) and M.S. in Computer Science from Columbia University. During my study in Columbia, I had great honor to work with Professor <a href="https://www.peterbelhumeur.com/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Peter Belhumeur</font></a>, <a href="https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Shih-fu Chang</font></a> and <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jrk/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">John Kender</font></a>.

I am Qiangeng(Charlie) Xu, a Research Scientist at Waymo Research. Perviously, I obtained my PhD degree from the <a href="https://www.cs.usc.edu/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Computer Science Department</font></a> of USC, supervised by Professor <a href="https://sites.usc.edu/cgit/contact/ulrich-neumann/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Ulrich Neumann</font></a>. 

My research interests and experiences range from Large-scale Vision-Language Models, End-to-End Robotic Agent, Diffusion Models, Video Generation, Neural Rendering, and Scene Understanding. I also like to explore information bottle neck theory and novel learning schemes.  
<br />
Previously I got my M.S. in Computer Science from Columbia University. During my study in Columbia, I had great honor to work with Professor <a href="https://www.peterbelhumeur.com/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Peter Belhumeur</font></a>, <a href="https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Shih-fu Chang</font></a> and <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jrk/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">John Kender</font></a>.
